EXAMPLE 

docker run -d -p 80:80 --name myContainer -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container nginx

- This will start a container from then NGINX image. If the image does not 
  exist on the host, the official image will be pulled from DockerHub. 

- The '-d'instruction will run the process in background. 

- The '-p' instruction will mount specific container ports to host ports. The 
  host-side port is on the left, container-side port on the right of the colon.

- The '-v' instruction will create a bind mount between two directories, one
  in the host file system and one in the container file system. The host-side
  mount point is on the left, container-side on the right.
